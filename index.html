                <h3>Vikings</h3>
                <p>Iceland was settled by Vikings from Norway sometime in the 800s. This fact makes Iceland a fairly “young” country when it
                comes to settlement, and also contributes to its distinct cultural background. The Icelandic horses in the country today
                are unique in the fact that they are direct descendants from the horses the Vikings first brought over from mainland Europe.
                The Vikings are the ones who gave both Iceland and Greenland
                their names, purposefully mis-naming them both so that their enemies would hopefully go to ice-covered Greenland instead
                of following them to where they actually settled in Iceland.</p>

                <h3>Tectonic Plates</h3>
                <p> The “geographical significance” part of Þingvellir being dubbed a UNESCO site is due to the fact that this
                is one of only TWO places in the entire world where you can see two of the earth's tectonic plates meeting above the earth's
                surface (the other is in Africa). The North American and Eurasian plates jut up out of the ground here in Þingvellir, moving
                apart roughly 2 cm per year.</p>

                <h3>Northern Lights and Midnight Sun</h3>
                <p> Being located very close to the Arctic Circle, Iceland experiences long winter nights and
                long summer days, with almost 24 hours of darkness/twilight in December and nearly 24 hours of daylight in June. Because
                of this, Iceland is a great place to see both the Northern Lights and experience the Midnight Sun. Though, both of these
                can be made difficult to see thanks to Iceland's ever-changing weather.</p>

                <h3>Elves and Trolls</h3>
                <p> The majority of present-day Icelanders (more than 50%, I was told) believe in the existence of fantastical
                beings such as elves and trolls. There are many amusing stories and legends about these creatures, and Icelanders go so far
                as to postpone construction projects if it's believed that something is going to be built where elves currently live. Large
                fallen rocks in fields are said to be frozen trolls, and one guide told us that the smell present in Iceland isn't from sulphur
                at all — it's the smell of the trolls' dirty bath water.</p>

                <h3>Glaciers</h3>
                <p> Surprisingly, another large section of Iceland is covered in glaciers. Glaciers are responsible for carving out
                everything in Iceland that hasn't been shaped by magma and earthquakes, making for a landscape more unique than any other
                country I've visited.</p>

                <h3>Volcanoes</h3>
                <p>Because it's located on the Mid-Atlantic ridge, Iceland is an incredibly active country geologically. There are
                more than 125 volcanic mountains in the country, a handful of which are still very active, and another handful that could
                easily awaken and become active as the country changes and grows. Iceland experiences a volcanic eruption roughly once every
                4 years, though the past few years have seen one eruption or more each year (we all remember Eyjafjallajokull, right?). Because
                of this constant activity, a good portion of Iceland is covered in lava fields.</p>
